\title{Generate Two Shifted Grid Clusters in High Dimensions}
\usage{
make_twogrid_shift(n = c(500, 500), p = 4)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{A numeric vector of length 2 specifying the number of points in each cluster.
Default is \code{c(500, 500)}.}

\item{p}{An integer specifying the total number of dimensions for the output dataset.
Must be at least 2. If \code{p > 2}, additional noise dimensions will be added.
Default is 4.}
}
\value{
A tibble with \code{n[1] + n[2]} rows and \code{p + 1} columns:
\itemize{
  \item \code{x1, x2, ..., xp}: Numeric coordinates of the points.
  \item \code{cluster}: Cluster membership label (factor with 2 levels).
}
}
\description{
This function generates two grid-shaped clusters in a 2D space, where one grid
is shifted relative to the other. Optionally, additional noise dimensions
can be added to embed the structure in a higher-dimensional space.
}
\examples{
# Generate 2 shifted grid clusters in 4-D
make_twogrid_shift <- make_twogrid_shift()
